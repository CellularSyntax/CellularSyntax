## Modeling the Human Sinoatrial Node

### Introduction

The heart's rhythm, that steadfast beat echoing life's very essence, begins in a specialized region known as the sinoatrial node (SAN). Understanding the SAN isn't just a matter of anatomy; it's about unraveling the electrical dance that initiates each heartbeat.

In 2017, a groundbreaking study by Alan Fabbri and colleagues [1] brought us closer to this understanding by constructing a comprehensive mathematical model of the human SAN pacemaker cell. Published in The Journal of Physiology, this work doesn't merely echo the rhythm of life; it deciphers its code.

Basing their model on electrophysiological data from isolated human SAN pacemaker cells and building on the Severi-DiFrancesco model of rabbit SAN cells [2], Fabbri et al. crafted a mathematical portrait that closely resembles the action potentials and calcium transient found in real human cells.

But why does this matter? It's more than a scientific curiosity. The model provides insights into the "funny current" (If) that modulates the heart's pacing rate. It explains how certain mutations affect heart rate, a finding that resonates with clinical observations. And perhaps most excitingly, it offers a valuable tool for designing new experiments and developing drugs that can tune the heart's rhythm.

Today, I invite you to delve into the heart of this paper with me. Let's explore the intricacies of the human SAN pacemaker cell, understand its rhythm, and appreciate the beauty of mathematical modeling in the realm of biology.

### Prerequisites for Implementing the Human SAN Pacemaker Cell Model

<p>Before we dive into the heart of the modeling, there are some essential tools and resources you'll need to have ready:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Python</strong>: The beating core of our code, Python is the programming language we'll use to bring this model to life. If you don't already have it installed, you can download it from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Python website</a>.<br/></li>
  <li><strong>Python Packages</strong>: These libraries act as the supporting vessels for our code:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>numpy</strong>: For numerical computations.</li>
      <li><strong>scipy</strong>: To leverage scientific and technical computing.</li>
      <li><strong>matplotlib</strong>: To visualize the results and plot beautiful graphs.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <b>You can install these packages using the following command:</b><br/>
    
```python
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

  </li>
  <li><strong>OpenCOR Software</strong>: This tool allows us to export the CellML model as Python, bridging the gap between biological understanding and computational implementation. Download OpenCOR at <a href="https://opencor.ws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>CellML Model of Fabbri et al.</strong>: The specific blueprint we'll be exploring, this model is key to our journey. You can find it readily available at <a href="https://models.cellml.org/e/568/HumanSAN_Fabbri_Fantini_Wilders_Severi_2017.cellml/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this location</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've gathered these components, you'll be well-prepared to follow along as we explore the computational intricacies of the human sinoatrial node model.</p>

### Python Code Generation from CellML File
<p>Generating Python code from a CellML file is a straightforward process, and OpenCOR makes it a breeze. With just one command, you can transform the Fabbri model into executable Python code. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open your command line or shell interface.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the directory where OpenCOR and the CellML file are located.</li>
  <li><b>Open your shell and execute the following command to generate a Python file from the specified CellML model:</b>

```python
$ ./OpenCOR -c CellMLTools::export myfile.cellml myformat.xml
```
  </li>
</ol>
<p>If you'd like to dive deeper into the code generation process and explore additional options, more detailed information is available on the <a href="https://tutorial-on-cellml-opencor-and-pmr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_generation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenCOR website</a>.</p>
<p>With the code successfully generated, you're ready to move on to the next steps, including model simulation and analysis. Let's get coding!</p>

### Understanding the Structure of the Generated Python Code
 <p>This section provides an overview of the generated Python code used for mathematical modeling in a particular domain. The code is divided into several functions, each with a specific role, to create, initialize, compute, and plot various mathematical and scientific parameters. Below, each function is presented with a description of its purpose.</p>

#### Function: <code>createLegends()</code>

    <p>This function initializes legends for states, algebraic variables, constants, and the variable of integration. Legends are used for labeling the plots.</p>
   

#### Function: <code>initConsts()</code>
   

#### Function: <code>computeRates(voi, states, constants)</code>
   

#### Function: <code>computeAlgebraic(constants, states, voi)</code>


#### Function: <code>custom_piecewise(cases)</code>
   

#### Function: <code>solve_model()</code>
   

#### Function: <code>plot_model(voi, states, algebraic)</code>
